# Pronouns in English

Pronouns are words that replace nouns, making sentences clearer and less repetitive. There are several types of pronouns in English, each with a unique role in sentences.

# Relative and Indefinite Pronouns

## Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns are used to connect clauses and provide more information about a noun. The most common relative pronouns are **who**, **whom**, **whose**, **which**, and **that**.

| Pronoun | Usage                                      | Example                                         |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Who** | Refers to people (subject)                 | The woman **who** lives next door is a teacher. |
| **Whom**| Refers to people (object)                  | The person **whom** you met is my friend.       |
| **Whose** | Shows possession                         | The girl **whose** car broke down is my neighbor.|
| **Which**| Refers to animals or things               | The book **which** I borrowed was interesting.  |
| **That** | Refers to people, animals, or things      | The movie **that** I watched was amazing.       |

### Usage Notes
- **Who** is used when the pronoun is the subject of the clause.
- **Whom** is used when the pronoun is the object of the clause.
- **Which** is often used in non-defining clauses (extra information), while **that** is more common in defining clauses (essential information).
  
## Indefinite Pronouns

Indefinite pronouns refer to non-specific people or things. Common indefinite pronouns include **anyone**, **someone**, **everyone**, **nobody**, **everything**, and **nothing**.

| Pronoun     | Usage                                     | Example                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Anyone**  | Refers to any person                      | **Anyone** can join the meeting.            |
| **Someone** | Refers to an unspecified person           | **Someone** left their bag here.            |
| **Everyone**| Refers to all people                      | **Everyone** enjoyed the party.             |
| **Nobody**  | Refers to no person                       | **Nobody** knows the answer.                |
| **Everything** | Refers to all things                  | **Everything** was ready for the event.     |
| **Nothing** | Refers to the absence of things          | **Nothing** was left on the table.          |

### Usage Notes
- Indefinite pronouns are often singular, requiring a singular verb. For example: *Everyone is here.*
- Some indefinite pronouns (e.g., **somebody**, **anyone**) imply an unknown or non-specific subject or object.

## Key Differences and Tips

1. **Relative Pronouns** introduce additional information about a specific noun or pronoun.
   - *The boy **who** won the contest is my brother.*

2. **Indefinite Pronouns** refer to people or things without specifying who or what.
   - ***Someone** called you this morning.*

3. **Agreement**: Indefinite pronouns typically take a singular verb, while relative pronouns agree with the noun they refer to.
