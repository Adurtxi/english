   - Often used with a "measure word" (e.g., *a glass of water*, *a piece of advice*).

## Plural Forms of Nouns

- **Regular Plural**: Add *-s* or *-es* to make the noun plural.

## Possessive Forms of Nouns

- To show possession, add an apostrophe + *s* ('s) to singular nouns.

- For plural nouns ending in *-s*, add only an apostrophe (’).
  - Example: The *teachers'* lounge.
